"""
Customized implementation of PPO. Originally taken from:
https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo_continuous_action.py

Original author: Costa Huang
Changes by: Shawn Hymel
Date: April 30, 2026

Changes:
 * Switched from torch.utils.tensorboard to tensorboardX to avoid LLVM conflict between TensorFlow
   and MuJoCo's shader compiler (causes segfault in same process)
 * Replaced "__main__" into a train() function so this file can be imported into
   e.g. a Jupyter Notebook.
 * Added ability to import a custom environment (rather than having to register one in gymnasium).
 * Made the actor and critic network architectures adjustable hyperparameters (variable number of
   hidden layers and variable number of nodes per hidden layer).
 * Added value_clip parameter to control clipping in the value (critic) network rather than reusing
   clip_coef (which forced reward normalization in environments).
 * Moved approx. KL divergence detection to each minibatch loop, so that we can stop training
   early before waiting for the end of the epoch if the action distributions drift too much
 * Added feature to save model checkpoints (best current model) throughout the training process.
 * Switched to Path() for saving model files (instead of raw strings).
 * Replaced cleanrl_utils.evaluate with a self-contained evaluate() function to remove the external 
   dependency.
 * Reorganized and added comments to make the implementation easier to understand.
